# Project Title:
“Baltimore Ravens Performance Analytics (1999–2019)”

## Project Overview 
This project analyzes 20 seasons of the Baltimore Ravens’ performance (1999–2019) using a combination of Python (data preparation) and Tableau (visual analytics). The goal was to uncover trends in scoring, rushing vs. passing behavior, and top player contributions.
Insights are visualized using dynamic dashboards and a storytelling format in Tableau Public. This project simulates what an analytics department in a sports organization might use for evaluating historical data and identifying performance drivers.

## Process 
Project Process
This project followed a full-cycle data analytics workflow—starting from raw data to interactive dashboards and insights:

- Data Collection & Preparation
Imported season-wise performance data of the Baltimore Ravens from 1999 to 2019, including:
Total touchdowns by season
Touchdowns by quarter
Rushing and passing yards
Game-by-game statistics
Player performance stats
Cleaned and standardized CSV files in Excel and optionally via Python
Ensured data types (e.g., year as dimensions, scores as measures) were compatible for visualization

- Data Exploration & KPI Development
Defined core KPIs:
Total touchdowns per season
Touchdowns per game and quarter
Yards gained by top players (run/pass)
Rushing vs. passing yardage split
Calculated derived fields like “Big Touchdown Games” based on thresholds

- Data Visualization with Tableau
Created the following sheets:
Line Chart: Touchdowns across 1999–2019
Stacked Bars: Rushing vs. Passing Yards per Season
Game-by-Game Touchdowns: Line graph with highlight for top games
Top Players: Horizontal bar chart by yards gained
Quarter-wise Analysis: Touchdowns by Q1–Q4
Built a Dashboard combining key views -<a href="https://github.com/Stephyoneal/Baltimore-Ravens-Performance-Analytics-1999-2019-/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-04-23%20120335.png">Dataset</a>
