# Project Title:
“Baltimore Ravens Performance Analytics (1999–2019)”

## Project Overview 
This project analyzes 20 seasons of the Baltimore Ravens’ performance (1999–2019) using a combination of Python (data preparation) and Tableau (visual analytics). The goal was to uncover trends in scoring, rushing vs. passing behavior, and top player contributions.
Insights are visualized using dynamic dashboards and a storytelling format in Tableau Public. This project simulates what an analytics department in a sports organization might use for evaluating historical data and identifying performance drivers.
